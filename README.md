# Partycles: Gamified Incentives for UniV4 Pools

ðŸŽ‰ ### Finalists of ETHLondon 2024

Welcome to Partycles, where collecting partycles gets you invited to the reward party! Partycles is a platform designed to incentivize and gamify activity on UniV4 pools by rewarding users with NFT scratch cards containing ERC20 rewards.

## How It Works

### Incentive Generation and Distribution

Swap fees collected on UniV4 pools are sent to a prize pool. From there, an ERC404 token is generated and distributed to LPs and swappers based on volume, rewarding users for their activity on Partycles.

### Collecting Partycles

As users engage in trading and liquidity provision, they accumulate partycles. Once enough partycles are collected, it automatically generates a PARTY NFT.

### The PARTY NFT

The PARTY NFT is where the excitement truly begins. Each NFT may contain a prize, but the catch is, you have to burn it to reveal the reward.

## Flexibility for Users

Users are not obligated to burn their NFTs. Alternatively, they can choose to sell these NFTs and ERC20 partycles in the secondary market. This flexibility fosters an engaging economy around PARTY NFTs.

## Technology Stack

Partycles leverages cutting-edge technologies to power its platform:

- **Uniswap V4 Hooks**: Utilizing the capabilities of Uniswap V4 for efficient trading and liquidity provision.
- **Nouns DAO**: Incorporating governance and community involvement through Nouns DAO.
- **Chainlink**: Integrating reliable and decentralized oracles provided by Chainlink.
- **Arbitrum**: Leveraging the scalability and efficiency of Arbitrum for seamless user experience.
